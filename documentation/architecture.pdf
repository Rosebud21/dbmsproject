overview :

This is an attempt at creating a virtual platform that encompasses all academic schedules and coursework ensuring a holistic online learning experience.
Weâ€™ll be designing an application that enables the academic community at MU to  have an uncomplicated mechanism while accessing academics.

we will be using a java gui based front end , further we will be connecting the java front end using java connectors and ensuring a dynamic data access and display mechanism.

for the database : we will be implementing a database using mysql: tables ,schemas and mutliple databases.
