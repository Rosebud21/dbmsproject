Overview 

This is an attempt at creating a virtual platform that encompasses all academic schedules and coursework ensuring a holistic online learning experience.
We’ll be designing an application that enables the academic community at MU to  have an uncomplicated mechanism while accessing academics.

We will be using a java gui based front end , further we will be connecting the java front end using java connectors and ensuring a dynamic data access and display mechanism.

for the database : We will be implementing a database using mysql: tables ,schemas and multiple databases.

 front end :

 a) pages:
    i) HOMEPAGE : This would be the very first thing that appears when a user runs the application.
        ->choose between logging in as a student or a faculty member 
        
    ii) upon clicking either faculty or student you will be directed to the student/faculty login page
        STUDENT LOGIN PAGE:
          -> a student will be asked to provide their student id/rollno  and password 
         -> if the password and id are present in the database , and match the login requirements 
               The user will be directed to the student dashboard.
         -> a user can also find a signup option on the login page in  order to enroll themselves in a                          
               New course by providing details(more about this in the student signup)
       STUDENT SIGNUP PAGE:
        -> a student can signup and enroll in their course and access course content.
       ->  fields - name , year , rollno, course
       -> after signing up a user will be able to access the student dashboard. 
      STUDENT HOMEPAGE :
       -> a student can view their courses as different tabs with the java tabbed pane.
       -> they can view the upcoming assignments and view their  course timetable.        
         
      FACULTY LOGIN :
        -> a faculty member trying to login must enter their unique id and password in order to access their faculty dashboard. 

    FACULTY DASHBOARD:
      -> faculty members can view their courses just as tabbed panes similar to the student dashboard.
 -> they can view their timetable for the day as well as upload and edit assignments and grades respectively.
      
b. Backend
Since we are using a desktop application and not a web application, we have not added much backend to our project. 
The backend aspect is open to third party applications. 
 
 c.  Database
       { we will be maintaining separate databases as that  makes it easier for data abstraction and  efficiency  is optimised as we  handle smaller tables};

            
Student database: 
            tables :
            1.1  student_details  :  contains the  student signup information
                              - name       varchar
                             - year           int 
                             - rollno         unique varchar, primary key 
                             - course       varchar(cse or eee)
                           
            1.2 Student _login : contains the login essentials          
                            - rollno          unique varchar ( connection between two tables)
                             - pwd           varchar
             1.3 grades 
                    Rollno-      
                   ( display with the faculty table columns )
                   Cgpa - 

 2. faculty database
 
         2.1 fac_details
              -> id’s             primary  unique varchar ( connection between login and details)
             -> course varchar(cse or eee) 
            -> name     varchar
           -> pwd        varchar 

     2.2 
          Fac_login
          -> id          unique varchar 
           -> pwd      varchar 
2.3  fac_grade
        -> roll no  
         -> cgpa
