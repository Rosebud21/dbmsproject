Overview 

This is an attempt at creating a virtual platform that encompasses all academic schedules and coursework ensuring a holistic online learning experience.
Weâ€™ll be designing an application that enables the academic community at MU to  have an uncomplicated mechanism while accessing academics.

We will be using a java gui based front end , further we will be connecting the java front end using java connectors and ensuring a dynamic data access and display mechanism.

for the database : We will be implementing a database using mysql: tables ,schemas and multiple databases.

 front end:
 a) pages:
    i) HOMEPAGE : This would be the very first thing that appears when a user runs the application.
        -> gives you the choice of choosing between your login options 
        -> student or faculty member 
    ii) upon clicking either faculty or student you will be directed to the student/faculty login page
        STUDENT LOGIN PAGE:
         
        
 
 
 
b. Backend
Since we are using a desktop application and not a web application, we have not added much backend to our project. 
The backend aspect is open to third party applications. 
 
 c. Database
Tables and their names and purpose
