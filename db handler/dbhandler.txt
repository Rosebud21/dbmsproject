db handler

1. First, you need to import three classes: SQLException, DriverManager, and Connection from the java.sql.* package.

2.Second, you call the getConnection() method of the DriverManager class to get the Connection object. There are three parameters you need to pass to the getConnection() method:

 a.url: the database URL in the form jdbc:subprotocol:subname
   -For MySQL, you use the jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databasename i.e., you are connecting to the MySQL with server name localhost, port 3006, and the database you're using          database databasename .
   -user: the database user that will be used to connect to MySQL.
    - password: the password of the database user
 
 3. we will use this MySQLJDBCUtil class for creating a new connection to MySQL as we proceed
